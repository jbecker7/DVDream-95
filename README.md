DVDream 95 is the next evolution of [DVDream](https://github.com/jbecker7/DVDream). The application is designed to emulate the old-fashioned DVD screensavers that were popular during the late 90s and early 2000s, transporting users back to the days of Windows 95 with a Vaporwave soundtrack and nostalgic VCR effects.
